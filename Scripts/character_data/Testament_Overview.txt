Boasting long range, crafty tricks and elegance in spades, Testament, the reawakened Gear, finally returns! Equipped with a massive crimson scythe, Testament controls the battlefield like no other.

Armed with impressive hitboxes on many moves, Testament is a strong contender in the midrange. f.S and 5H are particularly strong for grounded space control, with 5H adding a disjoint at the cost of safety. 6H is a bit slow, but reaches far both horizontally and vertically. For air control, j.S and j.D excel at contesting foes. Spicing up Testament’s space control is the Grave Reaper projectile. Both the grounded and aerial versions can be angled straight or diagonally with the S or H variants. It can also be powered up by partially or fully charging it, resulting in twelve different versions total.

After Grave Reaper has travelled its full distance, the projectile transforms into a Succubus that stays in place for a few seconds. The Succubus can be teleported to with Possession for a unique movement option. Unholy Diver fires Testament’s crow like a projectile, which tracks to the position of the Succubus. Nostrovia is a unique Overdrive that locks the opponent down under a barrage of attacks, allowing Testament to close the gap and enforce mix-ups. If Unholy Diver or Nostrovia make contact, the opponent is inflicted with Stain State. This opens up some new mix-ups and combo routes, such as converting off of uncharged 5D. You’ll need a good understanding of both the Succubus and Stain State to make the most of Testament’s unorthodox offense.

While Testament’s range is excellent, the same cannot be said for their frame data. Many moves are sluggish to start up or have long recovery. As such, wild swinging renders Testament vulnerable to Counter Hits and punishment. To mitigate this danger, remain calm and calculated. Wait for the right moment to strike.

If you’re looking for a character with excellent range and tricky mix-ups, then this glamorous Grim Reaper is a perfect match.

Testament is a midrange zoner, capable of controlling the pace of a match with their succubi and various projectiles.
Pick if you like	Avoid if you dislike
Huge attacks and full-screen projectiles covering large swaths of the screen at a time.
A fundamentals-principled design, with strong pokes, projectiles, and anti-airs, doing the basics expertly.
Creating situational utilities in neutral to alter the behaviour of moves and reward awareness.
Slow movement without much alternative for traversal.
A read-based offense reliant on stagger pressure needs you to make predictions to keep pressure.
Many manual timings and microdashes in combos and offense.

Unique Mechanic: Stain State
Testament's Unholy Diver projectile and Nostrovia Overdrive put the opponent into Stain State on contact. Stain State lasts for up to 300 frames at maximum, and ends when either triggered by Testament or when Testament gets hit. Hitting an opponent in Stain State with any of Testament's normals, Arbiter Sign, or the scythe slash of Grave Reaper causes an automatic follow-up Stain attack that can be used to extend combos on hit or maintain pressure on block. A full list of Stain State frame data is available to read here.

An important combo and pressure starter in Testament's kit, this move is vital to their game plan. While it is slower than many other c.S's, its long active frames and varied gatling options (the most out of Testament's kit) lead to strong pressure if blocked and combos if hit. Without dash momentum, blocked c.S will leave Testament just outside throw range but just close enough to still be in c.S's activation range for a potent, automatic throw bait.

Universal overhead attack. Tapping D gives a fast but weak overhead, while holding down D will give a much slower but much more powerful strike.

Uncharged Dust Attack
As this is Testaments fastest grounded overhead, 5D is needed to threaten the opponent with grounded high/low mix-ups. Roman Cancels allow this attack to continue into further pressure or convert into a combo without charging it. Unique to Testament, Stain State also gives them a combo from uncharged 5D and leaves them +5 on block, allowing safe resets and powerful frametrap followups. Can gatling from 5K, 2K, or c.S for a mix-up.

2H fills an interesting niche in Testament's moveset. Its primary use cases are to reset pressure and confirm off of Counter Hits such as c.S or mid-range f.S.

It launches on hit and has great scaling, at the cost of having high startup. The vacuum effect can be used to ensure that both hits of H Grave Reaper connect, leaving Testament slightly plus.

2H is best suited towards the beginning of combos or after Wild Assault, as its launch height is heavily affected by gravity scaling. 6H is often a better alternative that also deals more damage later in scaled combos.

These 2 things combined with the universal upper-body invulnerability of a 6P mean that this is an excellent normal to flail with, and many characters will have to drastically alter their neutral game in order to not run into its hitbox.

A niche air-to-air and pressure button, j.K has very specific uses. It is suited to combating air-to-air buttons, especially ones that come from beneath Testament. When combined with Stain State, usually after triggering Stain with 5K, it can lead into frame traps with aerial H Grave Reaper, as well as niche Safe Jump setups with Possession.

The move's small vertical range and poor frontal hitbox relegate it to these very specific use cases, with j.S and j.D more useful as general purpose air-to-airs.

Though Testament can usually cover jump-in attacks with 6P or H Grave Reaper, their air throw still makes for a reliable anti-air when there isn't enough time to apply a better option, scoring a knockdown and an opportunity to apply okizeme.

One of the most important tools in Testament's kit, Grave Reaper is incredibly versatile, being a key zoning tool, okizeme tool, and pressure ender. Proper use of Grave Reaper is a necessity, as it places a Succubus on screen for use with Possession and Unholy Diver.

With four versions and three levels of charge, there is a Grave Reaper for nearly every situation. Providing good control over timing, somewhat ambiguous animations, and air momentum changes, Grave Reaper can cover both ground and air as an effective zoning tool. Once the projectile is launched, the move can immediately be used again, while also giving Unholy Diver much more accuracy for even more zoning potential. Take care when performing the air version as it puts Testament into Counter Hit recovery, and it is in recovery until landing.

As a pressure ender, Grave Reaper leaves Testament plus with any charge and has huge pushback on block while setting up a Succubus, allowing Testament to threaten approaches with Unholy Diver, switch sides with with Possession, or approach with Possession.

The projectile can be used to hit meaty after combos even at long range, leaving Testament extremely plus if it can be charged while setting up a Succubus. OTG Grave Reaper is also useful after many knockdowns. This forms the foundation of Testament's okizeme which can be detailed here.

The S version projectile travels horizontally forwards. The H version projectile travels diagonally (upwards for 236H and downwards for j.236H).
Places the Succubus slightly past wherever the projectile finishes. Replaces the Succubus' location if it was already placed.
All versions can be held to charge the attack, improving damage and advantage, and allowing the projectile to travel for longer.
The scythe slash triggers Stain on contact, but the projectile does not.

(Note)
A projectile that's vital for setting up safe pressure, and a powerful zoning tool after Grave Reaper.

Testament's only method for applying Stain State without spending Tension on Nostrovia, you should aim to hit opponents with it as often as possible to make use of Stain for Testament's most powerful pressure and combos. It is commonly used during pressure after S Grave Reaper, acting as a ground-targeting projectile that is very plus on block, it enables completely safe pressure options and tricky mix-ups to take advantage of Stain. It is also a good combo ender, despite its low damage, as it usually sets up for powerful okizeme that utilizes Stain.

A situational anti-air from long range, its long active frames and fullscreen range are excellent at covering air dashes and it covers an angle that cannot be easily covered by Grave Reaper.

If whiffed, the crow will return at a lower height briefly, allowing it to hit most grounded opponents, which gives the move more viable use in neutral. After a short period, the crow will return to its normal position above and behind Testament.

Applies Stain State to the opponent on contact. If the wall breaks, the opponent will have Stain State active after the wall break.
When used raw, the projectile will travel in a straight path from the crow's starting position, but if an active Succubus is present it will fly towards that instead. Holding P will force the crow to always fly straight.
Cannot hit most opponents on the ground at its default height, except for Faust and Potemkin when standing.
When targeting a Succubus, the hitbox of Unholy Diver and Succubus meeting is active for 12 frames with Unholy Diver in recovery for 66 frames after.
The Crow
This projectile is unique in that its starting position is variable. In neutral, Testament is followed by a crow that normally idles above and behind Testament. Depending on its start and end points, it may hit on different timings and travel at different angles. Some situations can move the crow, especially when its trying to return to Testament after Unholy Diver, Grave Reaper, Nostrovia, or when Testament moves. These situations cause the crow to have a lower idle position for a small window of time. This allows Unholy Diver to hit standing opponents to continue pressure by applying Stain State.

A potent mobility tool, mix-up tool, and neutral tool. Due to Testament's poor movement speed, this is Testament's most effective way to close the gap without being easily reacted to, becoming essential for throw mix-ups and some pressure resets. Drifting to the left or the right after teleporting with (214K(4) or 214K(6)) makes these mixups even more potent. Possession in neutral can be used to force large grounded approaches to whiff or bait an anti-air while approaching from the ground. With a placed Succubus, it can also be used to side switch, particularly for escaping the corner. If the distance between Testament and the Succubus is very large, opponents cannot cover both areas at once, giving Testament more ways to contest their coverage of neutral.

One of the biggest weaknesses of Possession is the slow startup. Despite its late telegraph it is reactable and unsafe, especially if Testament needs to move anywhere before beginning an attack. Using 214[K] to remain in place can circumvent this and can cause the opponent to whiff their punish or throw tech. When used unpredictably, this turns it into a mix-up which even on reaction can be a 50/50. However, some situations may be unsafe regardless if one input can challenge both outcomes. This weakness can be mitigated in large part due to the ability to drift forwards and backwards with Possession.

Without a placed Succubus, this move loses most of its utility. It remains useful for stalling Testament's movement very suddenly, and can be used as a last-resort bet for avoiding anti-airs after double jumping or air dashing. However, this is extremely risky as Testament becomes exposed to an air Counter Hit combo if the opponent does not fall for the bait.

Teleports Testament to the location of an active Succubus. An active Grave Reaper will also end early, causing Testament to teleport to its position.
If no Succubus is present, Testament will disappear and reappear on the spot. Holding K will cause Testament to always stay in place.
Inputting 4 or 6 during Possession will cause Testament to drift backwards or forwards upon teleportation.

Despite its ambiguous animation, the overhead is still reactable. Additionally, due to the 4 frame gap between both hits, more savvy opponents will be able to Fuzzy Guard both versions. Combined with weak combo potential, and leaving a large gap in pressure, this makes it an objectively bad mix-up tool. Fortunately, it is able to function safely against meterless invincible attacks, giving the H version some utility in the corner with Stain State, though still a weak option overall.

The S version is a good anti-zoning tool, due to its massive tracking range that does not interact with projectiles. However, it is poor as a poke in neutral as it has a tendency to whiff moving opponents, and the H version—despite appearance—is unable to hit jumps. It can still be used as a risky option in neutral against low-health opponents to close out rounds.

It can also be used as a high-damage combo ender by sacrificing all other okizeme opportunities from Grave Reaper or Unholy Diver, primarily for ending a round. It can also be paired with the active projectiles from charged Grave Reaper or Nostrovia to enforce a basic mix-up on a blocking opponent, but this hinges on the opponent not jumping either projectile, after which Arbiter Sign will whiff and likely be punished by.

On a close range hit, the launch provides Testament with enough frame advantage to be able to safely jump in, something Testament can struggle with in neutral. The increased launch height also allows for combos into charged H Grave Reaper under certain situations, which can allow for good extensions. However, these options are quite niche, and as such players should not be fish for them in neutral.

A fantastic combo extender and ender, due to its huge corner carry and applying Stain State on wall break. With its hard knockdown and Stain State applied, Testament's follow-up okizeme becomes extremely strong. In combos, you can always input one last 6H or Arbiter Sign before Nostrovia wall breaks to optimize damage without losing the Stain State or knockdown on wall break.

Nostrovia excels as a corner pressure reset while the opponent is in Stain State. When cancelling or linking from a normal, opponents are unable to jump out even from substantial range due to the Stain explosion. This forces easy frametraps or mix-ups and resets into more Stain State pressure. In the corner, using 5D or 2K during Nostrovia results in a fast High-Low mix-up that immediately wall breaks on hit, remains advantageous on the low, and reapplies Stain State on block, allowing you continue pressure for even longer.

However, this move is very flawed in neutral. At mid range it can be punished on reaction with any Instant Air Dash jump-in. From farther out it is safer as Testament can either block in time or 6P attempts to get over Nostrovia's second hit that can anti-air with its larger hitbox. Unfortunately, at this range Testament is unable to reach the opponent in time to force a mix-up before Nostrovia is finished. While Testament is still at advantage afterwards, using an attack that can reach from that range expends Stain State. Because of its nature as a projectile, Nostrovia will destroy all other projectiles it passes through, giving it a niche usage for breaking through troublesome setups.

Last hit applies Stain State to the opponent on contact. If the wall breaks, the opponent will have Stain State active after the wall break.
Projectile will remain active even if Testament gets hit.
Unholy Diver cannot be used while Nostrovia is active.
Will not incur a Tension gain penalty if it is canceled before the super freeze.

Testament's only invincible reversal. Due to its comparatively slow startup, fast attacks like P normals can safely recover by the time Calamity One becomes active, making it a weak reversal and especially susceptible to Safe Jumps. It also suffers from only targeting forwards and not very high, making it prone to cross-ups and some airborne attacks with large vertical range.

As compensation, its slow startup makes it very good for invincible Purple Roman Cancels, in which by PRCing the move's startup Testament spends only 50% Tension to receive its full startup invulnerability, allowing them to whiff punish many moves, even very active ones, and easily check for mix-ups or if the opponent is blocking out of caution. This is not flawless and tends to be weaker against projectile okizeme and delayed/highly active meaty options, making it important to consider both uses. As RC startup is not invulnerable, Testament can also get hit out of PRC if done too early. However, because neither Calamity One nor PRC had time to complete, no Tension will be lost in that situation.

It also works as an alternative to Nostrovia but still does less damage than Nostrovia + any other move and doesn't apply Stain State after the wall break. An otherwise inferior option in the majority of combos.
