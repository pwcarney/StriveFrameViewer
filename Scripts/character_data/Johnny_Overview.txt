Johnny is a stylish swordsman who excels around the midrange with his signature Hirofumi sword style. What he lacks in defensive options, he makes up for with his ranged and often disjointed pokes that allow him to play a safe neutral game and keep opponents at a distance.

Johnny’s neutral revolves around his pokes. His f.S is remarkably fast and his 2S has enough range to challenge many options while keeping Johnny at a safe distance. Due to having a step dash, approaches are committal and getting close to the opponent is generally discouraged without a knockdown. Mist Finer’s many variants are capable of punishing neutral approach options, while its forwards dash grants the range necessary to check zoners. Johnny is able to convert many of his long-range pokes into knockdowns, using Deal to set up powerful okizeme options from far away. His lackluster defensive options mean that maintaining control of the neutral game to keep the opponent out is key to success.

Once the opponent has been knocked down with a card nearby, Johnny’s powerful offense can begin. His unique Turn Up mechanic allows Mist Finer to beat mashes, reversals, backdashes, and more from afar while otherwise leaving him plus on block. Johnny is capable of using this fact to his advantage in mix-ups, allowing him to use IAS S Mist Finer to form oppressive high/low mix-ups with rewarding conversions on hit.

With a wide variety of neutral tools and a few card tricks up his sleeve, this outlaw can offer unique answers to whatever your opponent throws your way.

Unique Mechanic: Step Dash
Unlike Giovanna or Leo, Johnny's step dash behaves irregularly. It is unable to be cancelled into a block or Faultless Defense, and does not apply momentum to moves used afterwards. To make up for this, Johnny has a unique dash-jump cancel that grants him improved aerial momentum (akin to an airdash).

Step dash can be cancelled at any time into Gold Burst
Dash-jump startup can be kara cancelled into specials or supers
Johnny's step dash and dash-jump have significant impact on how he is played. The momentum provided by dash-jump can be exceptionally useful as an approach option when dealing with projectiles or certain zoning options. It's important to refrain from dashing in neutral if the opponent is likely to poke with f.S or 2S, as you will be locked in the animation and unable to avoid or block the attack. Instead, utilize the range offered by Johnny's pokes, dash-jump, or Vault to close the gap.

Turn Up

Striking a card placed with Deal using any version of Mist Finer will cause the card to explode, dealing damage and allowing for unique combo, pressure, and mixup opportunities.

The followup hit caused by Turn Up will cause guard crush, leaving Johnny plus on block.
Turn Up allows for IAS S Mist Finer to be plus on block, allowing for pressure to continue after landing.
Turn Up activates 16F after the initial Mist Finer strike, allowing opponents to evade if the Mist Finer whiffs.

Johnny's main low-commitment poke. Because his leg lifts up high, it can be used to poke against low hits such as 2Ks, earning a knockdown and starting his oppressive pressure. Also frequently used in combos, especially Mist Finer Cancel routes, thanks to its speed, range and 6H gatling. An excellent all-rounder button to throw out.

An excellent c.S, with massive horizontal and vertical range. Its higher attack level than 5K means that if done perfectly, IAS S Mist Finer will hit as a gapless blockstring, creating a true 50/50 mixup between it and the grounded version. This mixup only becomes stronger with a card set, allowing for meterless extensions on hit. Mixing this 50/50 in between standard strike/throw, staggers, and frametraps from c.S's expansive gatling table and Johnny's special moves will make blocking c.S even more intimidating for the opponent.

It's also common combo fodder, since it naturally combos into 2H.

An amazing poke that combines range and speed while being slightly disjointed at the tip. 5H will almost always combo from it unless it hits at the absolute tip of its range, where you should use K Mist Finer instead. On counterhit, it can lead to 2H for a bigger conversion from roundstart distance. Outside of that spacing, it combos into Vault-Deal for a full combo extension.

Its main weakness comes from its susceptibility to low profile, though this can be mitigated by mixing up between it and 2S.

Massive normal with equally massive recovery. While not as disjointed as it initially appears, the strangely high hitbox lends it some use in checking retreating air movement. It can be used to end blockstrings, though make sure to Mist Finer Cancel it, as it's very unsafe.

As a level 4 move, it can combo into a dashing Mist Finer on crouching opponents, giving Johnny better okizeme and corner combos if you can confirm the situation correctly. Doesn't see much use in combos besides short conversions in neutral otherwise, as 2H is largely preferable for its launch.

Universal overhead, and the only overhead Johnny has access to on the ground. Johnny will often forgo using this attack due to the faster and more rewarding option of TK S Mist Finer. Which relegates 5D to being an overhead mixup after a blocked 2K, as well as the damage-optimal meterless wallbreak.

Even then, due to its significantly faster startup and much longer range, you will likely be using 6H to break the wall more often, especially considering it only does 3 less base damage.

Great combo filler and pressure normal. It's cancellable throughout its entire duration as soon as the first hit connects, allowing Johnny to vary up the timing of his frame traps or sneak in cheeky resets, and launches on the second hit for a wealth of combo options, making it great to gatling into from counterhits or anti-airs. It's very important to confirm into it, though, as it's very slow to recover if it doesn't make contact, hence limiting its use in neutral.

Requires counterhit to combo off of f.S and 2S, but combos naturally from c.S.
Varying the timing of your Mist Cancels is important to keep the opponent on their toes.

Due to Johnny stepping extremely far forward when using this move, it can be used as an alternative approach option to his dash when needing to put out a hitbox; hitting fairly high also makes it good at sniping opponents who are in the air. Options to threaten after it are somewhat limited, though it can be hard to punish if spaced. Since 6K is attack level 3, Ensenga naturally frame traps and combos from it, leading to combo opportunities even midscreen.

Can combo from 5K or 2K on crouching opponents, counterhit, and air hit for a bit more damage and corner carry.

The bread and butter of Johnny's entire gameplan, a stance which can be used to unleash long-ranged attacks with different properties depending on the button used to initiate it. Johnny cannot block, jump or crouch during the stance; because of this, it is important to occasionally not commit by cancelling the stance by pressing H or D.

This can also be used for Mist Finer Cancelling, a technique which replaces the remaining active frames and recovery of an attack with that of a Mist Finer Cancel, pulling Johnny's hurtbox back and giving them better advantage on block for high-recovery moves, an essential technique to learn for making his riskier normals safer. Mist Finer Cancels also allow Johnny to combo off his 2H by linking various normals after; compared to Vault-Deal and P Mist Finer, these routes are more difficult and position specific, but also lead to consistently higher damage.

Gives a slight float if used in the air. If cancelled, it maintains air actions, allowing Johnny to mess with his jump arc.
Dashing will also disengage the stance, though the attack can still be used mid-dash by releasing the button. This is important for combos.
The stance dash consumes an air action, so it can't be used after an airdash or double jump, but it can be used after a superjump.
There is no difference between which button you use to cancel the stance; it's entirely up to preference.

The easiest Mist Finer to use in neutral, allowing Johnny to safely poke at opponents while putting himself at minimal risk, though to be used carefully due to its significant frame disadvantage and the fact that it can still be low-profiled by many moves such as 6Ps. Its sheer range and speed also give consistent confirms from his long-ranged buttons, allowing Johnny to chip away at opponents' health while using their fear of his attacks to his benefit.

Conversely, it's usually the least rewarding to use in bigger combos, possessing no real advantage over the other two. However, in the corner, the tumble property it has on hit can allow combos into Joker Trick (236236S) at long distances, or full extensions with his normals if Johnny himself is close enough to the corner when it lands.

Johnny's strongest mixup tool. The grounded version strikes as a low, while the air one hits crouching opponents as opposed to the other Air Mist Finers, allowing Johnny access to an instant overhead on the entire cast. While already powerful in itself, a card makes this 50/50 mixup safe (in the case of the overhead) or plus (in the case of the low) on block, and allows a conversion from both even midscreen, though followups are more powerful in the corner.

Also commonly used as a combo ender, such as confirming 5H > dash S Mist Finer on crouching opponents and 2P abare.

The ground version trips into a hard knockdown similarly to a sweep, but works even if it hits someone in the air. On hit, Johnny can set up a card and then get a meaty after if this hits high enough.

Johnny throws a card, with its distance and trajectory depending on the button used. Throwing a card is fairly quick, allowing it to be used in neutral or okizeme to set up a favourable situation for Johnny; while the cards don't have a hitbox, striking them with any version of Mist Finer will activate Turn Up, adding a second hit that launches the opponent upwards on hit and guard crushes on block, giving significant frame advantage.

This can be used to set up strike/throw, crank RISC, make high/low setups safe or plus, and extend combos, so knowing when to throw a card or setting them up on knockdown is key to getting started with Johnny.

It has an initial strike when Johnny throws the card and a second hit when the card makes contact with the opponent.

Landing only the first hit will result in a hard knockdown tumble for both versions, though this is much easier to accomplish with the air version. Johnny can extend into a combo by hitting the opponent during the tumble.

Johnny leaps forward, covering a significant distance, evading low attacks and some projectiles. Since it can be cancelled into, it can be confirmed from counterhits to get Johnny in while allowing him to set up a card, and even extend the combo in some cases.

Using Deal from this move tosses the card at a more shallow diagonal angle; if using it from a launch, such as from 2H, delaying the card toss will allow Johnny to follow up after with 2K or c.S, giving significant corner carry or even allowing for a side switch from certain starters. It can also be used as a combo ender to set up an immediately threatening mixup situation while sacrificing damage.

Roman Canceling after the Deal followup allows Johnny to set up extended pressure sequences or high/low mixups, making Vault a powerful option with Tension. Vault RC is also an important tool in neutral against opponents with long reaching attacks, allowing Johnny to move in quickly and start his offense.

Deal followup can be executed at the earliest timing by holding H when inputting Vault.
Delaying Deal can vary the frame advantage of the move, up to -1 and out of throw range if perfectly timed.
Executing Deal during Vault increases the total duration of the move to 53 frames.

Interesting move which can be used to end blockstrings almost entirely safely unless the opponent Instant Blocks it. It only true blockstrings from level 4 normals or if used during Turn Up, and serves as an unthrowable 2f frametrap from 6K and c.S (the opponent can still reversal or low profile with 6p). Since Johnny jumps into the air, it can be used as a low crush (though misses against low profile moves) or to beat throws with great reward if it counterhits.

Using it to wall splat is common due to its short recovery and being cancellable from Johnny's normals, allowing him to dash up to use That's My Name (632146H) if so desired.

Johnny's exceptionally cool reversal and metered wall break of choice. The first hit has good range, and it can be used to wallbreak after a dash even after a max range K Mist Finer wallsplat. When used as a reversal, it leaves the opponent quite a ways away from Johnny (about halfscreen distance), which can be good or bad depending on the matchup, though Johnny can generally dash up after to get decent pressure regardless.

Due to its longer-than-average startup, the Super PRC trick can also be used to make this reversal "safer".

Some safejump setups that don't otherwise work will beat this super, as it's two frames slower than average.
The move's range can also be increased with Kara Cancels to wallbreak from further away.

Due to its incredibly fast startup and hitting very far away, this super is amazing as a hitconfirm from Johnny's normals, which will do a good amount of damage and also deny the opponent their burst. It is also surprisingly safe on block when spaced outside of the range of the opponent's normals.
