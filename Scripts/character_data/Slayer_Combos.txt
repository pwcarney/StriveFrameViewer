fS(1) combos into Bloodsucking Universe, fS(2) links into 5K/2K when further out and cS when closer.
UNIVERSE hits are mini fatals to oversimplify them (Change this when we learn more)
Fill out as needed.
	Basic combos are simple combos with the fewest requirements and conditions possible. They:
Work against every, or almost every, character in the game
Can be performed from most positions in the play area
Require few adjustments, and if any are required they are simple


Basic 5P/2P ConfirmFor when mashing works.
Very Easy
[5P/2P]xN > 236P
Super simple confirm that leaves you +2 on hit. Either punch can hit up to 3 times at point blank.



Easier Slash confirm
Very Easy

(c.S >) f.S/2S > 2H > 236K
Super simple confirm which connects pretty much always, even when blocked. Swap in 5H when you hit an airborne target. Nice when starting off, but there are better options out there.



Basic 5K/2K/2D ConfirmBetter punch has better confirm
Very Easy

(5K/2K >) 2D > 236K
Basic confirm for the Kicks and 2D.


	Core combos balance potency with consistency. They:
Work against most characters of a selected weight or hurt box type
May require moderate adjustments to account for variables such as screen position, hit count, resources, and opposing character
Are expected to be consistently performable by most intermediate and advanced players who main the character


BnB Slash comboHP magic trick
Easy

(c.S > f.S,) c.S > 6H > 214P~P (WS, 6H/214P~P WB)
Peak damage, reaches wall from almost midscreen distance, and can be even more deadly with meter. Dandy! Safejump comes with shipping.



CH K Mappa extentionHow to get cornerpressure from roundstart
Easy

CH 236K > 5K > 236K
Shouldn't whiff, but even then it won't hurt to try



(Almost) universal combo pickupFun fact: almost all of the starters can be turned into pilebunker loops as well!
Easy

Certain starters > c.S > 6H > 214P~P/214K~P (WS, 6H WB)
You usually use 214P~P, but some require the other one to not sideswap. If the starter causes a launch, you can otfen replace the c.S with 5K for an easier pick-up or do c.S, 5K instead for extra damage.

Starters include:

CH 6H > 214P > ...
CH 5H > 214P > ...
CH 2H > 214P > ...
CH 2D > ...
UNIVERSE 6K > ...
(only grounded) c.S > f.S > ...
(in corner) CH 236K > ...
(in corner) CH 2D > 236K > ...
CH 214K/P~S > ...
CH 214K/P~K > ...
CH 214K/P~H > ...
Anything > 66RRC > ... VERY USEFULL!!
... > Any H > 236D > ...
j.S > ...
j.H > ...


Basic 6P ConfirmThe f.S/jump-in killer
Very Easy

6P > 236K
CH 6P > 214P~P
If you really need to use 6P, you got at least some extra damage.


	Specialized combos are advanced routes which require more knowledge and awareness, but offer advantages over core routes. They:
Can have any number or combination of requirements and conditions—character, spacing, hit count, resource, or situation specific
Offer some advantage over core routes; be that in damage, corner carry, okizeme, meter gain, etc.
Might not necessarily be harder than core combos, but require more specific circumstances and knowledge to execute


Another c.S ConversionA very Dandy start to Slayer's combo theory.
Medium
[c.S > f.S,]x2 5K > 2D ...
A basic combo that leads to a bunch of different things. You could OTG with c.S, you could do K Dandy for an auto timed meaty, or even a crossup by dashing afterwards, or you could do K Mappa for corner carry. It's up to you to decide what you think is best.

Alternatively, you could cancel into BSU after the first hit of either f.S.

A slight loss in damage for a great mixup.



Counterhit Launch ConfirmGetting reward easily from counter-hits.
Medium
Starter > c.S > 5[D] > 5K > 6H > 214P~P
Confirm with good damage and corner carry that works almost universally from large counterhits, 2H being the exception. Valid starters are 5H and 6H, 2D, and It's Late/Master's Hammer. (Dandy Step > S/H) Wallsplats from midscreen.

The timing and leniency of the combo varies slightly based on the starter. After 5H/6H, a 214P cancel may be necessary to close the distance, but they both give ample time to hit. Sometimes, c.S can be used instead of 5K if Slayer is close enough.

With the Universe buff active, 5D and Bump Ahead (Dandy Step > K) will also work as starters.



Bloodsucking universe confirmYummy Floor 10's
Medium

(c.S >) f.S, c.S > f.S (1) > 63214H
Sacrifice damage for the UNIVERSE pressure.



Wild Assault ExtentionAnywhere is wallbreak distance
Easy

Any H Button > 236D > c.S > 6H > 214P~P (WS, 6H WB)
Increase damage, go an extra half of the screen, and connects consistently. On-Block it adds 3 additional auto-timed frametraps/mix-up oppertunities.



CH c.S comboPilebunker Loops my beloved.
Medium

CH c.S > 5[D], c.S > 214P~P, c.S > 2S > 2H > 214P~P
High damage combo off of CH c.S that works anywhere.

Note that if you do this while cornered, you will want to Dash-Kara Cancel the first Pilebunker so that the combo can wallbreak.


Roundstart CH 2H
Roundstart CH 5H
Roundstart CH 6H

Roundstart CH 2HLowest Damage Option, but the safest.
Medium

CH 2H > 214P, c.S > 2S > 214K~P, c.S > 2S > 2H > 214P~P WS! 214P~P WB!
Just because this is the lowest damage combo of the 3 here doesn't mean that it doesn't do much damage. You're opponent will watch in fear as ~70% of the HP just disappears.


Roundstart CH 5HThe most realistic option, next to 2H.
Easy

CH 5H > 214P, 2H > 214P~P, c.S > 2H > 214P~P, c.S > 6H > 236K WS 214P~P WB
Very similar to the 2H combo, but with a higher damage output. One of the easiest setups to confirm, but it's a little hard to get a CH 5H


Roundstart CH 6HHighest damage option, but somewhat niche.
Very Hard

CH 6H > 214P, dl.2S > 214K~P, c.S > 2H > 214P~P, c.S > 6H > 236K WS, 214P~P/632146S WB
This combo actually builds enough tension to do a super wallbreak at roundstart. Getting the dl.2S can be quite hard occasionally.



CH 5K ConfirmNot even Nago has legs like these!
Hard
CH 5K > 236D > c.S > f.S(1) > 63214H
A simple CH 5K confirm that guarantees a BSU from any distance from which the initial hit can connect. If the opponent doesn't burst before WA, then this is a burst safe route into BSU.

Roundstart CH 5HThe most realistic option, next to 2H.
Easy

CH 5H > 214P, 2H > 214P~P, c.S > 2H > 214P~P, c.S > 6H > 236K WS 214P~P WB
Very similar to the 2H combo, but with a higher damage output. One of the easiest setups to confirm, but it's a little hard to get a CH 5H


Roundstart CH 6HHighest damage option, but somewhat niche.
Very Hard

CH 6H > 214P, dl.2S > 214K~P, c.S > 2H > 214P~P, c.S > 6H > 236K WS, 214P~P/632146S WB
This combo actually builds enough tension to do a super wallbreak at roundstart. Getting the dl.2S can be quite hard occasionally.



CH 5K ConfirmNot even Nago has legs like these!
Hard
CH 5K > 236D > c.S > f.S(1) > 63214H
A simple CH 5K confirm that guarantees a BSU from any distance from which the initial hit can connect. If the opponent doesn't burst before WA, then this is a burst safe route into BSU.

Pilebunker Loop Theory

What is a Pilebunker Loop?
A Pilebunker loop is a staple of Slayer's combos, which makes use of the technique known as a back-hit. Back-hits occur when Slayer hits an opponent with Pilebunker while they are directly above him, which manages to send them into rolling tumble while still being behind Slayer as he travels, and they are left in a state where he can continue the combo with c.S.

All PB loops require either a counter-hit or RRC to initiate. Due to their finicky nature, combos can be somewhat character-specific due to the shape and size of the opponent's collision box being different.

Starters
I wish you a merry christmas (Check the starters for your daily dose of loops)

When and how to extend the loop
As a general rule: If you used 3 moves before a PB, extending won't work, while setups using 1 or 2 moves before Pilebunker work.

Setups that you cannot extend:

CH c.S > 5[D] > c.S > 214P~P
CH 2H > 214P, c.S > 2S > 214K~P
Setups you can extend:

CH 6H > 214P, delay 2S > 214K~dl.P
CH 5H > 214P, 2H > 214P~P
You usually extend by doing c.S > 2H > 214P~P, but big bodies require c.S > 2S > 214K~P.

c.S > 2H > 214P~P does more damage, and knocks targets further away.
c.S > 2S > 214K~P does slightly less damage, knocks the target less far away, and when next to the wall, can occacionally wallstick, causing the extention to whiff (not gud).
There are times where you need to use the one of the extensions for their specific knockback distances. This is because there is one section in the map where neither the sideswap finisher nor the far hitting finisher can reach the wall, and you need to adjust your position preemptively with a different extension. It's not flawless, so sometimes you simply cannot wallbreak. In cases like these you can end early by not extending and immediately breaking the wall.

Ending the combo
When you are with the back to the Wall, use c.S > 2S > (2H >) 214P~P WS, 6H/214P~P WB. You may need to ommit the 2H to wallstick at further distances from the wall.

When you are Midscreen, do c.S > 6H > 236K WS, 214P~P WB or c.S > f.S > 5H > 236K WS, 214P~P WB.
The f.S version should be preferred when using an overdrive to wallbreak in combos with at least 5 hits before the starter.
Otherwise, the 6H version not only does more damage (or goes even), it even knocks back enemies further, making wallsticks from the middle of the screen possible.
You should generally prefer doing 6H.

If you wouldn't Wallstick due to being too far away, do c.S > 2S > 2H > 214P~P

You usually don't want to use Last Horizon as your combo ender due to the high RISC scaling, but Super Mappa Hunch is a nice way to tack on extra damage on the Wallbreak while also getting a knockdown Post-Wallbreak.

In theory Pilebunker loops are possible, but not recommended. 5K is usually the better option between the two, since the starter doesn't need to connect very close and it has much better pushback (So higher odds for a wallstick) as a trade-off of doing 4-5 points less damage.			1.37

Roman cancel on the first hit of the throw, before all damage is done, to make this route possible. Since the second pilebunker splats a few frames after it connects, there's enough extra time for slayer to recover and deliver another pilebunker to wallbreak.	YT	213091

Your most consistent Wallbreak tool is 6H.

If you wallbreak with anything besides a Dandy Step follow-up, you can safely wallbreak with 214P~P. If your opponent had at least a little bit of air time (you only need 1 frame!) before the opponent sticks to the wall after a Pilebunker, then you can also wallbreak with 214P~P.

Breaking the wall with 632146S is always available, primarily being done for extra damage/super wallbreak. In extremely high scaled combos this adds more damage than a regular attack (due to the minimum damage mechanic), making it useful for closing out Pilebunker loops/Metered combos.

"Breaking the wall" with 236236H is always available, as long as you are close enough to the wall. Since it doesn't actually break the wall, it's only used to finish off low health enemies. This is especially useful if the opponent had risk built up before the combo, massively increasing damage.

236D can also be used for super wallbreak only, but it's usefulness is questionable

Thanks to the link of f.S, c.S, you can vastly extend your Slash combos.

Note: This only covers meterless options, go check out the S-starter page for some combos using meter

From a grounded c.S/f.S/2S, you generally can go four* paths:

... > f.S (1) > 63214H
... > 2H > 214P~P
... > c.S > 6H > 214P~P
... > f.S, 5K > 2D


The easy enderCount to 3
Very Easy

... > 2H > 214P~P
Since it doesn't require any specific S button beforehand, it is the most universally applicable one by far.

The main difficulty lies in not whiffing the 214P~P, is is caused by high gravity scaling.

To figure out how much you can add before the 2H, you simply need to count to 3. This is the total amount of moves you can do, before the scaling is too high.

Do a maximum of 3 S moves before the 2H. Any jump-in counts as 2 moves.
Some example combos are:

c.S > f.S, c.S > 2H > 214P~P
f.S, c.S > f.S/2S > 2H > 214P~P
CH f.S, f.S, c.S > 2H > 214P~P
j.S, c.S > 2H > 214P~P
j.H, c.S > 2H > 214P~P


Confirm into GrabFishing for UNIVERSE
Easy

... > f.S (1) > 63214H
While doing much less damage by itself, it can provide massive pressure thanks to the various high-damage CH confirms

You need to route your combo into ending with f.S (1), then quickly input Bloodsucking Universe.

The combo ender can fail in two ways:

Instead of doing f.S (1), you were close enough for a c.S, making the grab whiff.
You input the grab too slowly, getting the second hit of f.S, making the grab whiff.
Especially the first problem can be a little difficult, since it can be hard to gauge if you are close enough for a c.S. If you aren't certain, just use another combo ender instead or quickly react.

Example combos:

(c.S >) f.S, c.S > f.S (1) > 63214H
(c.S >) f.S (1) > 63214H
(far hit) CH f.S > f.S (1) > 63214H
(close hit) CH f.S, c.S > f.S (1) > 63214H
j.S, c.S > f.S (1) > 63214H
j.H, c.S > f.S (1) > 63214H


The best enderOptimal
Easy

... > c.S > 6H > 214P~P (WS, 6H/214P~P WB)
While is appears to be not much different to the 2H pickup, this version does much more damage and knocks the opponent further away, making wallbreaks more likely. Additionally, it doesn't rely on gravity scaling to connect, making it much stronger in longer strings (f.e when extending with RC or WA).

For this combo ender you need to route into c.S, limiting the options slightly.

Example combos (Note):

c.S > f.S > c.S > 6H > 214P~P
f.S > c.S > 6H > 214P~P
(start with c.S) c.S > 6H > 214P~P
j.S > c.S > 6H > 214P~P
j.H > c.S > 6H > 214P~P
(c.S > f.S,) c.S > 6H > 236D > c.S > 6H > 214P~P
UNIVERSE 6K > c.S > 6H > 214P~P


Confirm into Hard KnockdownLeo will be PRETTY jealous
Medium

... > f.S, 5K > 2D
While doing slightly less damage, it enables one of Slayers strongest Mix-ups

You need to route your combo into ending with f.S, which is not too difficult to achieve. It is much easier to react if you connect a f.S or c.S, making hitconfirms much more reliable than the BSU setup.

(Add Mix options here!)

Example combos:

(c.S >) f.S, c.S > f.S, 5K > 2D
(c.S >) f.S, 5K > 2D
(far hit) CH f.S > f.S, 5K > 2D
(close hit) CH f.S, c.S > f.S, 5K > 2D
j.S, c.S > f.S, 5K > 2D
