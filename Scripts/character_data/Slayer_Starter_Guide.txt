Getting gud navigation
Find your own way. You can use YouTube, the Slayer discord, friends or the other dustloop pages to find how to improve from here. All I will do is give you guidance on what to look for next

1. Learn how to use 236K in neutral, especially the kara-cancelled one (It's very easy, don't worry)

2. Learn how to do S combos (Look in the Combos page for more info)

3. 4/6D safejump into j.H. Easiest one in the game.

4. Learn simplified combos out of CH (It's the box up there) and also CH 236K > 5K > 236K

5. (Blockstring)Pressure. What can you do out of 236K/236P? What is your mix out of f.S? How do you end your combos safely (Hint: 236K/236P)? What options do you have out of 2S? When and how can you use your Dandy-step followups in blockstrings?

6. Oki pressure from 63214H.

7. Figure out when you can wallbreak with 214P~P

8. Pilebunker loops baby. Some excellent recources are:

The Combo page
Video guide video
Setups (Especially the CH ones) video
You can start off by always ending instantly after the first pilebunker with c.S > 2S > 214P~P, then slowly learn which starters can be extended, learn how to end loops optimally, and later also take a look into the sea of RC pilebunker setups.

9. Pilebunker Safejumps

10. Use OTG to create nasty mixups (Example starters: 4/6D, 2D, Dandy-Step follow-ups)

11. Learn how to add 236D and RC into your pressure

12. All the other niche combos. If you got to this step, you might wanna look for other places to improve. If you really want one last thing, check out kara-cancelled Bloodsucking Universe. You'll be busy for long enough for someone to find some more insane tech for you to play around.
