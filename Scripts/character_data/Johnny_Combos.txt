Move Notation

As Mist Finer stance is used in a number of unique ways in combos and pressure sequences, there are a number of shorthand notations used for different actions revolving around actions in stance.

Notation	Full name	Meaning
PMF	P Mist Finer	Mist Finer : Upwards
KMF	K Mist Finer	Mist Finer : Horizontal
SMF	S Mist Finer	Mist Finer : Downwards
6XMF	Forwards Mist Finer	The notated Mist Finer includes a forwards Mist Finer Dash before releasing the button.
4XMF	Backwards Mist Finer	The notated Mist Finer includes a backwards Mist Finer Dash before releasing the button.
MFC	Mist Finer Cancel	Indicates that Johnny enters Mist Finer stance and immediately leaves it as a type of cancel.
MS	Mist Step	Johnny enters Mist Finer stance, dashes forwards, and exits the stance.
DJk	Dash-Jump Kara Cancel	Johnny kara cancels the startup of a dash-jump into a special or Overdrive.
MFk	Mist Finer Kara Cancel	Johnny kara cancels Mist Finer Cancel into an Overdrive.

All damage values are tested on Ky at full health with the R.I.S.C Level at 0 unless the combo cannot work on him, in which case the character with the closest defense modifier is used.
This list is meant for actual combos, not for frame traps, blockstrings, or mixups. (If the combo itself allows to set them up afterwards, it is mentioned in the "Notes" field).
The list is focused on most practical examples, not every single option that exists.
The difficulty is ranked on a scale of 1 to 5 (Very Easy, Easy, Medium, Hard and Very Hard) based on various factors (cancel leniency, link timings, special techniques, range consistency, etc).

Johnny's combos, though rather simple in concept, have a lot of different routes for optimization and setup. generally combos like to follow one of two routes depending on position.

Starter/Launcher > 214[P]66]P[ > ender (midscreen)
starter/launcher > 6H loops > wallbreak (corner)
Overview
Launchers

Basic OverviewFor if you just want the fundamental principles.

Johnny's combos generally involve getting his opponent into the air, then juggling them with a combination of P Mist Finer (214P), Turn Up (if a card is already present), Mist Finer Cancels (214[X]D) from 2H and 6H, and Vault~Deal (236H~H).

Once the combo has been extended, S Mist Finer (214S) will provide a HKD to allow for close oki and K Mist Finer will provide an up-to-full-screen knockback effect for a more zoning-focused reward.


LaunchersAnd how to route into them.

The standard launchers to use near the beginning of your combos once you've landed the hit are 2H, 214K, j.D, and 6K > 214[P]66]P[.

Example combo starters:

c.S > 2H > MFC: Generally the starter for Johnny's hardest punishes since MFC adds no RISC and no combo decay, as opposed to specials like 214P that have 2000 RISC loss and therefore scale the combo heavily.
CH 5P/2P/5K/2K > 6K > 214[P]66]P[: A way to confirm from any abare button into a launcher on CH. From 5K and 2K, you can connect to 6K on crouching opponents without CH. 66 Mist Finer gives a bit of extra height that allows for the combo to continue.
Landing j.K > j.D: A corner-only launcher that adds minimal RISC and can lead into c.S.
5P/2P/5K/2K/f.S/2S/5H/6H > 214K: Corner-only "launcher". K Mist Finer tumbles, allowing for 5K and f.S relaunches early into combos.
5K > dc~214P: A midscreen launcher that doesn't quite work at max 5K range but works on non-CH standing hit.
Starters
johnny's starters are pretty limited but he usually finds a use for each of them

c.S/5K > 2H. This is Johnny's best starter by a good margin due to its consistency. the launch from 2H is an amazing setup for both P finer juggles and for 6H loops.
CH214H. A little less consistent than the above option, but functional nonetheless. In midscreen you will have to forgo the P Finer and just skip straight to 5K for the pickup. Much better starter in corner as it leads to the highest damage from 6H loops.
AA/CH6P > 214[P]66]P[. A little weird and not often used, but functions as a starter nonetheless. You need the P finer even if you're in corner
Extenders
214[P]66]P[. Mainly used for midscreen combo extension. The pop up from the slash gives johnny enough time to catch them with a c.S or 5K to lead into your ender.
6H loops. Johnny’s best corner extender. The actual loop itself is [Air hit c.S / 5K > 6H > MFC]xN. Usually you can get about 2 loops before wallsplat.
Scaling Theory
Johnny has some unusual RISC loss values on his specials, leading to optimal routes requiring the use of specific normals like 6H and 5[D] where possible. Below is a table of Johnny's attacks, and how they relate in regards to combo damage and scaling.

Attack	Damage	RISC Loss	Damage / RISC (x1000)	Normalized (c.S)
Enders
Unlike his starters, Johnny has a lot of different ways to end his combos that leave him in some form of advantage.

5K/c.S > 6K > 236K > (214[K]66]K[). Gives a lot of corner carry as the 6K launches them very far and the card from 236K keeps you safe to close in. if you do chose to use the K finer, you can usually get about two step-dashes in before they get up.
5K/c.S > 6K > (214[S]66]S[) alternative ender to the above for a closer knockdown at the cost of corner carry. The HKD from S finer lets you set up a P card and catch them on block with a c.S to start mix.
5K > 6K > 632146H > (236K). Metered ender that still gives you time to set a card and catch it with a K finer to start mix.
Wallbreak
5[D]: Highest damage meter less wallbreak option. Also Johnny's slowest startup normal with somewhat poor horizontal range, will not work in all routes even with MFC's.
6H: Second highest damage normal, generally used in cases where 5[D] won't work. Depending on combo scaling and guts, may do the same damage as 5[D].
214K: Longest range and fastest special attack. Does less damage than 6H but is much easier to use.
236236S: Fast, full-screen super. Very easy to use but deals less damage than 632146H. Requires 50% Tension.
632146H: Johnny’s most powerful super. Can almost always be used by Mist Finer dash-kara canceling into it. Requires 50% Tension.
