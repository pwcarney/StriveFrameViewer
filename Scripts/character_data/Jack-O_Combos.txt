Beginner Combos and Theory

One of the biggest weaknesses Jack-O' has is a lack of combo potential without first setting up or being in the corner. So your first step, and one of the best things that can be done, is a very simple knockdown to summon a servant. Among most basic confirms, these end in Summon Servant (Hold) (notated as 236[P]), and it is central to Jack-O's strategy.



Throw Servant okizemeIt's as good as you're going to get for now.
Easy
f.S > 5H > 236[P] > Wait > hs.6X
Off any knockdown that sends the opponent far, you may cancel into Summon Servant (Hold) and throw it at the opponent as they get up.

There's two versions of this, if you throw the servant early, it will not hit the opponent, but places a servant behind the opponent for a very favourable "sandwich". If thrown a bit later, it will hit them as they stand up, you don't get a sandwich but it prevents them moving or doing anything without being hit. Both are good outcomes, so it's not too important to worry which you get, but the timing does differ a little based on the combo you did.

With that in mind, any confirms are generally just leading towards a basic knockdown with this, and it is crucial as Jack-O' to get servants set up as a general habit, even if you are not yet confident in using servants.

Basic Knockdowns

Jack-O' has several basic strings leading to a knockdown, that also have practical utility as pressure against an opponent.

c.S > f.S > 5H	Basic blockstring, f.S and 5H also make good attacks in neutral.
(5K or 2K) > 2D	Fast pokes leading to a strong knockdown. 2K is especially good at close-range.
(5P or 2P) > 6P	Very fast attacks. 6P is the go-to anti-air while 2P is the go-to abare.
(IAD j.S or j.H) > 2K > 2D	Jump-in attack. Additionally, IAD j.H frametraps with 2K for good pressure.
236K	Servant Shoot is a good frametrap for ending pressure, if it hits the opponent is launched very far.
Each of these knockdowns cancels into Summon Servant for okizeme, as mentioned previously. Note that knocking down with a 2D allows you time to throw the servant behind the opponent and instead okizeme with c.S

Counter Hits

c.S > f.S > 5H	Basic blockstring, f.S and 5H also make good attacks in neutral.
(5K or 2K) > 2D	Fast pokes leading to a strong knockdown. 2K is especially good at close-range.
(5P or 2P) > 6P	Very fast attacks. 6P is the go-to anti-air while 2P is the go-to abare.
(IAD j.S or j.H) > 2K > 2D	Jump-in attack. Additionally, IAD j.H frametraps with 2K for good pressure.
236K	Servant Shoot is a good frametrap for ending pressure, if it hits the opponent is launched very far.
Each of these knockdowns cancels into Summon Servant for okizeme, as mentioned previously. Note that knocking down with a 2D allows you time to throw the servant behind the opponent and instead okizeme with c.S
Jack-O' generally doesn't change much with Counter Hits, except for specifically 2D and 5H, which can lead into enormous combos from anywhere. These routes can be quite involved, being the primary midscreen combos Jack-O' has.

Combo	Description	Recipe
5H CH, 5K > 6H > 236[P]	Basic confirm.	25562
2D CH, 236P > 2K > 2D > 214K > Dash c.S > 5H > 236[P]	A short version of the 2D BnB route.	89227
While the 2D route looks intimidating at first, it is relatively lenient, you simply need to Dash after Attack Command, and is the core to 2D combos. Furthermore, this is not indicative of usual 5H routes, however the routing available differs based on which hit connects for the Counter Hit, this is one of your only easy options that will work regardless of it.
Jack-O's Forever Elysion Driver (FED) deals enormous damage early into a combo. In fact, an optimal combo with meter is rarely getting substantially higher damage, but instead is more for Tension gain and corner carry. This will be your main use of Tension for combos, and not Roman Cancels. As a super, it's very easy to simply end any combo into it. It's more important to learn when you cannot use FED. Far-launching attacks such as 236K, 6P, and the second hit of 6H are likely to cause whiffs, completely wasting your meter.

Combo	Description	Recipe
5H CH > 5H > 632146P	Uses Tension. Can still work from second hit of 5H	25564
If a servant is already on the field, Jack-O' can combo anything into Attack Command (214K) for an easy combo starter. Combos using Attack Command are extremely lenient, but can be fairly lengthy.

hs.6X > 214K > 214K > 214K	Attack Command loop, can be used any time you hit an opponent with a servant.	89222
214K > Delay > c.S > 2H > 214K > Delay > c.S > 5H > 236[P]	Sandwich combo, this works if a servant was behind the opponent	25570
214K > Dash > c.S > 2H > 236K > 214K > WS > 6H	Corner combo, extremely lenient routing.	25571
One of the main advantages to Attack Command is its enormous launch means you can usually fit any 2 attacks between Attack Command uses to keep a combo going. However, this wastes Servant Gauge, and usually is not very high damage compared to more optimal routes. In addition, when hitting an opponent with an Attack Command loop from afar, you will wish to only use Attack Command once or twice, to conserve your Servant Gauge.

Sandwich Combos

When a servant is behind the opponent, Jack-O' has a range of versatile 'sandwich' combos allowing her to fully combo off any hit, offering great value for hits that normally cannot combo.

To begin a sandwich combo, simply hit Attack Command with a servant behind the opponent. This can be done from 2D, f.S, 5H, even 6P.

If Jack-O' is too close and the opponent is falling behind, simply backdash after using Attack Command. You will have enough time to keep the combo going as normal.

Main Combos

This list is meant for actual combos, not for frame traps, blockstrings, or mixups. If the combo itself allows to set them up afterwards, it is mentioned in the "Notes" field).
The list is focused on most practical examples, not every single option that exists.
All damage values are damage dealt to Ky unless the combo cannot work on him, in which case the character with the closest defense modifier is used.
The difficulty is ranked on a scale of 1 to 5 (Very Easy, Easy, Medium, Hard and Very Hard) based on various factors (cancel leniency, link timings, special techniques, range consistency, etc).
Anywhere it says [2D > ...] you can go into most anything besides grab super.
Please be aware that there is a bug in training mode that causes hits not to prorate if you pause mid-combo. If you are testing values please do so without pausing the game. (Video - https://twitter.com/shadowd63/status/1433399624690192388)

Round Start
Round Start has a fixed position, meaning many of your combos can be carefully prepared, however due to the large distance you will usually only be able to combo off particularly strong hits. Interestingly, Jack-O' from her best confirms is able to wall break, but usually should avoid a wall break as the value of the corner is extremely high.

CH 236K > 5P > 6H > 236P (setup)	Corner				2D > 236K is a natural frame trap and can be converted into a combo in the corner. Keep in mind that 236K is unsafe without using Servant gauge.	

Combo Theory

214K Loops
When converting from 236K*(hit) > (214K)xN - Every character has a route that allows them to do up to three iterations of the (214K)xN loop. Choosing how many loops depends on the distance from the corner, and the amount of Servant Gauge you are willing to spend;

If you are in the corner, one iteration will cause WS. From here you can break the wall with another iteration of 214K just like midscreen, but you could always also do 632146P or 44 6H(2nd) if you wish to save your Servant Gauge.
At midscreen, if you wish to cause WS, you will need to do at least 2 iterations. From this position you can choose do a 3rd iteration if you have the Servant Gauge, trading bonus damage for returning to neutral post wall-break without the ability to Summon Servants immediately.
In terms of actually landing the combo, routes are character specific. Characters fall into three groups;

(SO, KY, CH, ZA, RA, LE, NA, GI, AN, IN, GO, JC) - Most of the cast is either lightweight or has a smaller falling hurtbox, meaning that 236K will never hit them, allowing the combo to go off cleanly. This is the easiest group.
(MA, AX, FA, MI) - Some character's forward hurtbox while falling is too big, causing the 236K*(hit) to occur too early or in extreme cases cause 236K& to occur. For these characters you will only land one 214K unless you delay the 236K.
(PO) - The only exception to this group is Potemkin, who no matter how much you delay 236K, will always be hit by 236K, forcing 236K& and only one 214K. Instead, you must slightly delay the normal that comes before 236K* (usually 5P). This changes the trajectory of the servant from 236K& just enough to allow you to do multiple loops of (214K)xN, and only Potemkin is wide enough while falling to allow this route.
Backwards 214K Wall Combos
Keeping the opponent away from the wall until the very last moment is essential to maximizing damage output when extending combos in the corner. Jack-O' is capable of doing just that with a specific servant positioning mid-combo. When comboing after the wall-bounce from 236K&, if you delay the c.S& appropriately so that the opponent is currently just passing over your servant, you will push the servant to the wall without the projectile ever hitting your opponent. You can then use 2H > 214K and the minion will be in the correct position to knock the opponent away from the wall, allowing another c.S string before the WS. As long as the combo starts at the correct distance from the wall, this route becomes very consistent with practice when you know what you're looking for. If everything goes correctly, the Servant will be near the floor, and will hit the opponent's feet as a projectile before performing Attack Command. If you ever find the servant in the incorrect position for the combo once you've already committed to 2H, you can use 236K& to recover the combo. Luckily enough, even if you mess this route up you will still get a WS from all of the incorrect routes except for one (c.S > 2H(hit) [No Servant Gauge to 214K]), so as long as you watch how much Servant Gauge you have you will still get your Positive Bonus.

By using 214H during the dead time during 236K you can construct a route that uses two Wall Sticks and will usually deal more damage than a combo that does not incorporate Countdown. The advantages of more damage are obvious, however there is a drawback to these routes. When the explosion of Countdown begins, you deplete all of your Servant Gauge. You will be able to recover roughly 2/3rds of one servant during the end of the combo, but that still means that you will not be able to summon a minion immediately upon returning to neutral after the wall break. This means that if you intend to continue you pressure after the wall break, you may want to perform a route that does not include 214H. Conversely, if you are reaching for damage and intend to kill the opponent from this position, then of course this route is most likely to grant you the most damage. A general positive of these combos is that while it will return your Servant Gauge to 0, it may not necessarily cost 3 Servant Gauge to perform, making them very possible in a real game.

These combos end with two routes;

Route A; ... dl.c.S > 5H WS, 9 (Detonation) j.S WS, [5[D]] or [632146P]
This is by far the easiest of the routes. It's so consistent that the hardest concept to grasp in this combo is actually the Backwards 214K. Plus, the [5[D]] is also incredibly easy to time due to landing after the j.S.
Route B; ... dl.c.S > 2H > 236K& WS, 4(4) (Detonation) 2D WS, [5[D]] or [632146P]
This is the harder version of the same idea. When compared to the other route, this has a lot of possible drop points. Firstly, the 236K& WS can sometimes break the wall if you don't delay all the dl.c.S as late as possible, meaning that you will not be able to finish the combo with [632146P] and potentially lose out on the kill. Secondly, the opponent must WS at a decent height before the Detonation, otherwise they will fall to the ground before you can reach them.The last problem that arises from this route is that the starter dramatically changes the position of the servant at the end of the combo. This causes a disparity that sometimes requires you to Backdash (44) to dodge the explosion, and other times being far enough to simply hold 4 and freely walk out. The 2D timing can be much tighter for the same reason.
Ultimately, since this combo has a 1-2 damage discrepancy from the other safer route it is not recommended to do unless you are confident that this combo will kill where the other won't. With Guts and Defense Ratings in factor, the fact that this can be very hard to determine in the moment makes this a very rare, but possibly valuable option. The good news is that if you are experienced with this combo, you can decide if you delayed your dl.c.S's mid-combo to determine if this route is even possible, then switch to the easier route if you are worried about a drop.
Wallbreak Enders
Jack-O' has several optimal ways to end a combo:

5[D] for most damage at close-range.
2H for most damage at mid-range, or most tension at close-range.
6H(2) for most damage at long-range.
214K for most damage from mid to long range at the cost of Servant Gauge.
Prior to any wallbreak, it is always worth using Summon Servant (236P or 236[P]) where possible, as the servant will be recovered free of cost on the wallbreak, providing an additional half a bar of Command Gauge (while breaking even on Summon Gauge), restoring resources to assist in the post-wallbreak situation.

At the cost of minimal damage, Jack-O' is uniquely good at generating Tension on a Wall Stick by cancelling into 236[P] > hs.D > ns.2P > (236K or 632146P), which is fast enough to be used on any wallbreak if within range. You can still optimise for meterless damage using 236[P] > hs.D > (5[D] or 2H or 6H)
